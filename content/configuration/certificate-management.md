# Certificate management

To enable HTTPs for REST API endpoints, the server requires an SSL certificate. Certificates identify client applications and machines on servers and allow for building a secure communication link. The Client Failover Service generates a self-signed certificate with a 15-year expiration date during installation. Instead of being in the machineâ€™s certificate store, the certificate can be found in a data folder (`%PROGRAMDATA%/AVEVA/Client Failover Service/Certificates`) on your machine.

The certificates folder contains a public CRT certificate file and a private KEY file. It allows read access for all users of the machine and the virtual service account (NT SERVICE\AVEVAFailover). The private KEY file can be found in a subdirectory named Keys. This folder is only accessible by machine administrators and the virtual service account.

**Note:** The certificate used by Client Failover Service must be trusted by the device running the adapter. If it is not trusted, the [ValidateEndpointCertificate](xref:HealthEndpoints) must be set to false.

If the SSL certificate is set to expire within 30 days, the message log receives a warning message. If the SSL certificate has expired, the service logs an error message to the log, but continues to use the certificate.

## Replacing the SSL Certificate

The certificate that the Client Failover Service generates is applicable to most scenarios. However, you may prefer to replace the default self-signed certificate with one issued by a certificate authority.

To replace the SSL Certificate, an administrator must:

1. Delete the existing public certificate (with the CRT extension) from the **Certificates** folder.

2. Convert the CA-issued certificate to a public with a CRT extension and the certificate's private key to a file with a KEY extension.

    **Note:** The CRT and KEY files must be in PEM format and share a common file name (e.g., MyCertificate.crt and MyCertificate.key).

3. Stop the service.

4. Place the CRT file into the **Certificates** folder and the KEY file into the Keys subdirectory.

5. Restart the failover service.

If the service does not start properly, check the message log for additional information.
