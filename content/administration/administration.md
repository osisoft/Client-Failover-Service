# Administration

With the failover service administration level functions, you can can change logging levels, set up OMF Health Endpoints, delete a group, and perform and cancel a role override. 

The examples in the administration topics use `curl`, a commonly available tool on Windows as well as Postman, a REST tool for systems with GUI components. You can use the same operations with any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls.
