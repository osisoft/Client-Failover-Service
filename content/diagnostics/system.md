# System

The `Diagnostics.System` dynamic type includes the following values which are logged in a stream with the `Id` `System.Diagnostics`.
This diagnostic stream contains system level information related to the host platform on which the adapter is running.

| **StartTime**                         | `string` | Time at which the host process started                                            |
| **WorkingSet**                        | `long`   | Amount of physical memory in bytes, allocated for the host process                |
