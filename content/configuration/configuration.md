# Configuration

Client Failover Service provides configuration of log levels and health endpoints.

The examples in the configuration topics use `curl`, a commonly available tool for Windows. You can configure the client failover service with any tool that supports making REST calls. To validate successful configurations, you can perform data retrieval (`GET` commands) with a browser, if available, on your device.

For more information on configuration tools, see [Configuration tools](xref:ConfigurationTools).
