# Client Failover Service

Client Failover Service

**Version 1.0**

## Overview

The Client Failover Service is an application that minimizes data loss by enabling adapter-level failover. This service manages multiple failover groups by assigning primary and secondary roles to adapters in each individual failover group.

This service acts as an endpoint that receives and sends failover messages to and from adapters. These messages report on the health of the adapter, help inform the adapter of its role within the failover group, and provides users with the ability to monitor the adapter's health.

This is the intial release. 

For more information, see the [Client Failover Service overview](xref:index).
